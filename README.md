# IMDb-Scrape

This is my first website scraping code built in Python using BeautifulSoup. Here, I have tried to extract the Top 250 Movies listed in IMDb website into a workable Excel file with simple coding. This way any Webpage data can be rendered into an excel file using Python for further analysis and visualization.
